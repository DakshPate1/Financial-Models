# üìä Financial Models (Under Construction üöß)

Welcome to **Financial-Models**, a growing repository of valuation frameworks designed to bring clarity, rigor, and reproducibility to financial analysis. This project is currently under active development ‚Äî so expect some scaffolding, half-built dashboards, and the occasional rogue spreadsheet. But the vision? Crystal clear.

## üß± What‚Äôs Being Built

This repo will eventually showcase **four core valuation models**, each tailored to real companies:

- **Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)**  
- **Comparable Companies Analysis (Comps)**  
- **Precedent Transactions**  
- **Asset-Based Valuation**

Each model will be accompanied by:
- üìÅ Clean folder structures for each company
- üìÑ Summary reports with assumptions and outputs
- üìä Visualizations and dashboards (Power BI, Tableau, etc.)
- üßæ Documentation for reproducibility and professional presentation

## üõ†Ô∏è Current Status

- ‚úÖ Data scoured for select companies (e.g., Sarepta Therapeutics, RoboSense)
- üß™ Early model drafts in progress
- üìå Commit history reflects simulation work and initial structure
- üìù README just added ‚Äî you're reading it!
